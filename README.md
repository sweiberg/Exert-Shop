# Exert Shop
Exert Shop is an e-commerce solution that will allow users to buy and sell merchandise with listings that utilize both fiat and crypto currencies. Users will be able to sign up, add to their cart, make purchases, review their purchases, and leave feedback to sellers. The goal of this project is providing a framework for how a modern marketplace should situate itself for a digital future.

Exert Shop is the group submission for Project Group 42 in University of Florida’s CEN3031 – Intro to Software Engineering.
