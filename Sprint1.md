Issues we planned to address: <br />
For visitors, we wanted to address how to view products listed for sale, create an account to become a site member, and an organized navigation interface.<br />
<br />
Issues successfully completed: <br />
The backend team implemented the user registration that integrates RESTful API using Gin and created a universal Postgres database package that can easily be incorportated into future packages and features. The backend also incorporated a Go port for Ruby's dotenv library to support ENV files for load variables.<br /><br />
The frontend team created a mock up of a product listing and navigation system that utilizes JSON data, this has prepared these components to be fully integrated with data pulled from the backend. The frontend also created the initial framework for the project and integrated numerous libraries that are used for Angular and Go.<br />
<br />
Issues not completed: <br />
We were largely able to achieve our goals for the Sprint 1 deadline, although we did so in a way where the backend is not yet fully integrated with the frontend. We also planned on implementing functionality for user sessions, however we delayed this issue for Sprint 2.
